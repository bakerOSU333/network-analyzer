# Network Analyzer

## Features

1. **Data Visualization**: Visualize network latency data over time in easy-to-understand charts.
2. **Network Latency Monitoring**: Perform regular network latency checks using the `ping` command. You can set the frequency of checks (from every 1 minutes to once a day) via a cron job to automate the process.
3. **Process Bandwidth Usage**: Track bandwidth usage by individual processes, displaying both incoming and outgoing data.
4. **Download & Upload Speed**: Measure and display your current download and upload speeds.

Please notice this program **ONLY** runs on macOS.

## How to Use

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod 777 scanning
   ```

2. Start data collection:

   ```bash
   ./scanning
   ```

   **NOTICE**: At this stage, a window will pop up asking for some permissions. These may seem unusual, but the script is only setting a cronjob on your computer. The script does not contain any viruses. You can download the project and use Go to build and run it yourself without executing the pre-built script:

  ```bash
  go build -o scanning
  ```

3. For advanced options, run:
   ```bash
   ./scanning -a
   ```

### Advanced Options Menu

Upon running the advanced options, you'll see the following menu:

A terminal option screen will appear with various option, pick what you like!

```
What do you want to do?:
>  Cronjob options
   Show process network usage chart
   Show network latency chart
   Quit
```

#### Options Explained

- **Cronjob Options**: Modify or remove the existing cronjob that automates network checks.
  ```bash
  Cronjob options:
    Edit cronjob time.
    Remove cronjob completely.
    Come back.
  ```
  The options are self-explainatory

  If you want to see the cronjob this program has set up, do:
  ```bash
  crontab -l
  ```

  The cronjob working directory will resemble: `$Yourworkingdir/go-networking/scanning`.


- **Show process network usage chart**: These charts display the cumulative amount of data sent and received by processes since their creation. Note that the data shown is the total accumulated over time, not the current data transfer in any specific period.

  1. Received Network Data. This chart highlights the **top 3 processes** that have received the largest amount of data.

  2. Sent Network Data. This chart highlights the **top 3 processes** that have sent the largest amount of data.
     ![sent network data chart](./img/sent-network-data-chart.png)
  3. In addition to the charts, a detailed table with all processes and their network usage is displayed in the terminal. The processes are **ordered by the average amount of data received**.

- **Show Network Latency Chart**: No need to explain more!

  2. Speedtest chart

All HTML charts are stored in the `chart/html` folder for future access.

### Data Storage

- **Network Bandwidth Data**: Stored in `network/network.txt`.
- **Network Latency Data**: Stored in `ping/ping.txt`.

## Motives

This project was created as a way to get familiar with the Go programming language, combined with an interest in networking.

## Terminal commands being useds

- **Latency Data Collection**: Uses the built-in macOS `ping` command (`ping google.com -c 10`) to gather latency data.
- **Bandwidth Usage**: Uses `nettop -l 1 -P -x` to monitor bandwidth usage by each process.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several folders, each responsible for specific functionalities related to network monitoring, data tracking, and visualizations.

## Folders Overview

### 1. `chart/`

- **Description:** Contains all the code for creating charts, which are rendered as HTML files.
- **Files:**
  - `chart.go`: Handles the creation of all charts.
  - `html/`: Subfolder where the generated HTML charts are stored.

### 2. `cronjob/`

- **Description:** Manages cron jobs for scheduling tasks. This includes the creation, deletion, and editing of cron jobs.
- **Files:**
  - `cronjob.go`: Code for setting up, deleting, and editing cron jobs.
  - `cron.txt`: Text file for setting up cronjob.

### 3. `network/`

- **Description:** Records and reads network data, preparing the necessary data for the process network usage chart.
- **Files:**
  - `network.go`: Handles the recording and reading of network usage data.
  - `network.txt`: Store all the data used for process network usage chart.

### 4. `ping/`

- **Description:** Tracks network latency by recording and reading ping data, preparing for the network latency chart.
- **Files:**
  - `ping.go`: Code responsible for managing ping data for latency charts.
  - `ping.txt`: Store all the data used for network latency chart.

### 5. `speedtest/`

- **Description:** Manages speed tests by recording and reading speed test data, which will be used in the speedtest chart. This chart appears when the process network usage chart is opened.
- **Files:**
  - `speedtest.go`: Handles speed test data tracking and preparation for the chart.
  - `speedtest.txt`: Store all the data used for speedtest chart.

### 6. `main.go`

- **Description:** The entry point of the program, responsible for initializing the entire application.

## Limitations

- **Latency Measurement**: The `ping` command only measures the total round-trip latency, so it cannot distinguish whether upload or download is slower.
- **Process Name Length**: The `nettop` command truncates long process names, but it's usually clear enough to identify the associated application.
